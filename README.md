# Tuned-Mass-Damper
This file allows the optimal design of an inerter based tuned mass damper via pattern search algorithm in Matlab. The controller is attached to a SDOF structure which is excited by a white-noise ground acceleration. The optimal design variables are the damping and stiffness ratio of the controller.
